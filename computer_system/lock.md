In computer science a lock or mutex is a synchronization primitive: a mechanism that enforces limits on access to resource when there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy, and with a variety of possible methods there exists multiple unique implementations for different applications.
