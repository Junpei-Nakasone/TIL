# What is tsconfig.json
Node.js itself doesn't support TypeScript so a `tsconfig.json` file is needed as configuration file when using TypeScript.

The presence of a `tsconfig.json` in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The `tsconfig.json` file specifies the root files and compiler options required to compile the project.


# Options

### outDir

Specify an output folder for all emitted files.
