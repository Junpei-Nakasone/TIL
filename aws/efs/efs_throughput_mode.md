### Throughput modes
A file system's throughput mode determines the throughput available to your file system. Amazon EFS offers three throughput modes: Bursting, Elastic, and Provisioned.
Read throughput is discounted to allow you to drive higher read throughput than write throughput.Depending on the AWS Region, the discount for reads is between 1.66 and 3x.
