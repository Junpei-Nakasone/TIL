The processor, or CPU, is arguably the most important hardware component. It's responsible for telling the other parts what to do, mush like your brain. The processor is also an integral component in determining how useful an electronic device will be.

Processors are ranked in terms of hertz, or more commonly gigahertz e.g., 2.5 GHz. This is the frequency they run at. Generally, the higher the speed, the better the performance. Three different manufacturers produce a vast majority of the processors available for purchase.

1. Intel. Intel is the most popular and well-known maker of processors. Manufacturers like Dell, Apple, Samsung and HP all use Intel processors in their computers. INtel processors are the most stable and offer the best all-round performance.
2. AMD. AMD is Intel's biggest competitor, offering processors that are similar to Intel's, but at a, for the most part, cheaper price. The majority of computer manufacturers, except for Apple, also offer products with AMD processors. AMD's
3. ARM. ARM processors are generally used in smartphones, mobile devices and tablets. A rule of thumb is, if it doesn't have AMD or Intel in the name, it's most likely an ARM processor.
