# What is .bashrc file

A .bashrc file is shell script which is executed whenever a bash script or bash shell is started.

So .bashrc file is read when you type bash and push enter key.
Although your login shell is bash, .bashrc file is not read when you logged in.
In that case, .bash_profile file is read.
If you configure to read .bashrc file in your .bash_profile, .bashrc file is read when you login.
