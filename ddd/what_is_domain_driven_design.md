Domain-driven design(DDD) is a major software design approach, focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code(class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain.
For example, if sogtware processes loan applications, it might have classes like loan application, customer, and methods such as accept offer and withdraw.
